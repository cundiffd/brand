Who me? Why yes, I've entertained the idea of therapy.\
One on ones, where you tell me:\
"Oh yes, I see. You are the emotional trash can."

I must say I have never heard that one before.\
Tell me more about this "emotional trash can".

"You are where everyone goes to dump their emotions!"

Well, I'll be!\
Come, world, dig around! We've got it all!\
Fear, anger, feelings big and small!

Digging for a little bit of joy? We've got it.\
Guilt and shame? Plenty of it!\
You may even find some love in here, if you're lucky!

I'll be the best damn emotional trash can,\
Believe that!
